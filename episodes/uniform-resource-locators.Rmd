You might already be familiar with websites bringing together a mixture
of content, such text, images, video or 3D models. 

Delivering/retrieving content over the web provides many advantages:

- Being able to easily access the content regardless of which
platform they are using, such as PCs, mobiles or a VR headsets.
- Using common Internet interfaces and protocols (e.g. HTTP/HTTPs) 
to query, retrieve and display content.


## Web Basics: Uniform Resource Locator
In order to understand how to create stories over the web that 
link multidimensional data, it is first necessary 
to learn how data, of any type, is made available over the Internet.

A webpage is usually written in HTML and other web-languages, 
such as JavaScript, TypeScript or PHP. This code is 
in remote computers so that everyone can access the webpage they render.

To find webpages, we use 
a link on a browser 
called an URL (Uniform Resource Locator),
such as [https://www.brighton.ac.uk](http://www.brighton.ac.uk), 
[https://www.europeana.eu/en](https://www.europeana.eu/en). 

## URL Paths
Many webservers make use of the full URL path to send information
to the server. A URL path usually specifies the location of the file 
or resource that the user wants to access in the server. 

You will find this usually with images, PDF and other multimedia file that
a webpage will be including. For example:
[https://culturedigitalskills.org/wp-content/uploads/Logo-Banner-3-1-1024x244.png](https://culturedigitalskills.org/wp-content/uploads/Logo-Banner-3-1-1024x244.png)


## URL Anchors

Furthermore, URLs can contain a link to a specific section within a web page
by using anchors. You will notice the use of anchors on a URL, as they 
include using a **#** symbol followed by a word. This word is usually defined
in the HTML code so that the webpage knows which part the user is looking for.

See these examples:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

This is a very simple browser exercise, but it serves to get
the student thinking on things which are added to a URL for
processing by the webserver.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Try this examples

What is the difference of navigating to these two different URLs

- [https://sdgs.un.org/](https://sdgs.un.org/)
- [https://sdgs.un.org/#goal_section](https://sdgs.un.org/#goal_section)

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You will notice that the URL that contains the **#** symbol in the URL
takes you to the sepecific section with the 17 SDG goals.

## URL Query String (or Query Text!)

URLs can become more complex if we want the server which
is 'serving' our webpage to perform any additional 
functionality before, during or
after loading the webpage. 

The **?** symbol in a URL
is known as URL parameter or query string.

The query string is the portion of text 
which comes after the 
**?** symbol.

This text will be 
passed as data to the server.

The server might be running additional 
code which will process this text
and change the content of the webpage accordingly.

For example, in the query

>[https://www.google.com/search**?q**=*news*&**as_sitesearch**=*www.brighton.ac.uk*&**sort**=*date:D:S:d1*](https://www.google.com/search?q=news&as_sitesearch=www.brighton.ac.uk&sort=date:D:S:d1)

Note that you have three parameters:

- **q**: the search query.
- **as_sitesearch**: limits search results to documents in the specified domain, 
host or web directory.
- **date**: Sort results in descending order by date.

If the *text* or *strings* contains more than one word,
the spaces should be replaced by the + symbol. For example:

>[https://www.google.com/search**?q**=*the+future+of+the+metaverse*](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+future+of+the+metaverse)


More information about parameters for search: [https://www.google.com/support/enterprise/static/gsa/docs/admin/current/gsa_doc_set/xml_reference/request_format.html](https://www.google.com/support/enterprise/static/gsa/docs/admin/current/gsa_doc_set/xml_reference/request_format.html)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge: Use a query in a URL

Try searching a word in the [Europeana homepage][Europeana]

For example, search for the word: 'modernism'

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Try using the query text in the Europeana URL to search for the word modernism:

[https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&view=grid&query=modernism](https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&view=grid&query=modernism)

Now, try changing directly the search term to the URL to a phrase.

Go back to the [Europeana homepage][Europeana].

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



Query strings are also used by Application Programming Interfaces or (APIs).
In this lesson, we won't explore this subject in detail. 
But it will be
good you are aware that the information is 
passed to the server via the URL path.

For example, try the URL:

[https://gtr.gtr.ukri.org/gtr/api/projects/5B805CC1-2B54-4CAE-9243-8EF4AFC35E7E](https://gtr.gtr.ukri.org/gtr/api/projects/5B805CC1-2B54-4CAE-9243-8EF4AFC35E7E) 

This URL queries an API (or database running on the server)
to retrieve information that is contained in the database
about the AHRC funded project 'A Roadmap for a National Training Centre 
on Multidimensional Digital Media in the Arts and Humanities'. As you will see in the
webpage, the information is not an HTML page but another structured type of
data which contains various pieces of information about the project.

To understand how to use these URL, you usually need the guide to the API.
For example, the query specified above users the database of the
[Gateway to research guide](https://gtr.ukri.org/resources/GtR-2-API-v1.7.5.pdf).

## Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)

Although URLs are useful to retrieve a webpage, they are often not permanent. 

URLs might stop working after a project finishes
or funding ends to maintain a website.

Persistent identifiers (PIDs) address this challenge by ensuring 
the link to a digital object continue to exist in the long term.

The PID is a unique identifier that represents a something with a number or code.

They are similar to ISBN and ISSN which were used by publishers to
identify written texts.

Currently there are PIDs to identify:

- Contributor, inc. authors and researchers
- Data and Software, inc. datasets, tables, figures, videos, code, 3D models
- Publications, inc. books, articles, white papers, chapters
- Projects, inc. grants given by funders
- Organization, inc. institutions, funders, corporations, government agencies

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- URLs can be a simple means to find a website
- URLs can also include additional information which allows a server to change how the webpage is 'served'
- Anchors allow to easily jump to part of the page.
- URLs also provide the means to use a website as a database which can be queried via the URL path.
